<p>
I welcome your ideas to improve this website. Obviously, I won't make any promises, but I'm having a lot of fun working on this, and I'd love to hone my development skills and see what I can add to this project.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to hear about any bugs you encounter.
</p>

<p>
I'm also looking for other interesting and useful projects to sink my teeth into, so if you have an interesting idea, I'd love to hear about it. This could be a community database like <a href="http://mtgtop8.com">mtgtop8</a> or a simple resource like the GoatBots <a href="https://www.goatbots.com/ev_calculator">EV Calculator</a>. It could also be something completely outside the realm of Magic: the Gathering. Some resource like <a href="http://platinumgod.co.uk/">Platinum God</a> for Binding of Isaac, <a href="https://www.hotslogs.com/Default">HotsLogs</a> for Heroes of the Storm, or the <a href="https://theunderminejournal.com/">Undermine Journal</a> for World of Warcraft. It could be a reddit/twitch/twitter/discord bot. It could be a mod for a Steam game. Basically, I'm looking to broaden my (web) development knowledge and, as a gamer, I'd love to do something for the communities I frequent.

<p>
As of Mid-July 2018, I'm also looking for employment opportunities in the Boston area. Feel free to contact me if you have specific ideas or openings.
