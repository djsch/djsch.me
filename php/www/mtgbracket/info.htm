<h1>What's this?</h1>
<p>
The Magic Bracket is a community-driven project to vote on all Magic cards printed through the end of 2016. For more information on The Magic Bracket, visit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/mtgbracket">reddit.com/r/mtgbracket</a>

This website is a project that I created to better visualize the results of the bracket. You can see all the matchups for a particular card to date, or see the entire bracket for a particular card. In the future I plan to add other features, including the ability to create your own bracket, March Madness style, once the entire bracket is revealed in mid-July.
