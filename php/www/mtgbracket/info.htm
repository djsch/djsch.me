<h1>What's this?</h1>
<p>
The Magic Bracket is a community-driven project to vote on all Magic cards printed through the end of 2016. For more information on The Magic Bracket, visit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/mtgbracket">reddit.com/r/mtgbracket</a>
</p>

This website is a project that I created to better visualize the results of the bracket. You can see all the matchups for a particular card to date, or see the entire bracket for a particular card. In the future I plan to add other features, including the ability to create your own bracket, March Madness style, once the entire bracket is revealed in mid-July.

Update June 2020: As you might expect, I've largely moved on from this project. I made some updates today to fix a few things that have apparently broken over the last few years (and who knows how long they've been broken), but in general I don't expect to maintain the project long term. There are a couple things that are broken that I'm aware of, mainly that the entire top 8 doesn't seem to exist anymore, and it's possible I'll try to fix them at some point, perhaps if the Magic Bracket has some sort of renaissance and significant renewed interest for some reason. If you'd like to prod me to consider making any more updates or changes, you can always reach out on reddit (u/rakkamar) or email (daniel.j.schneider31@gmail.com).
