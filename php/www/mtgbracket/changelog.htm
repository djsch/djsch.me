<h3>10 Apr 2018:</h3>
<p>Bracket now only shows max 4 rounds. Trying to see a bracket that has more than 4 rounds pops up links to see other 'windows' of rounds. I'm not really sure I like this option, but I want a scalable option that will last through the entire bracket, rather that just making things a bit smaller for now and pushing off solving the real problem for later. I'm open to feedback if you have strong feelings on how the current option works.</p>
<p>Bugfix: Searching for cards with apostrophes would fail.</p>
<p>Bugfix: Backend didn't update when starting a new round correctly.</p>
